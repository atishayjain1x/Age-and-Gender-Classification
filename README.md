# Age-and-Gender-Classification
A deep learning model to classify age and gender of a person using facial features.
I have used UTKFace dataset.
UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. 
For this project, I decided to use Google Colab instead of Jupyter Notebooks on my personal machine. The primary reason for this was to utilize the free GPUs offered by Google to train my deep learning models.It is faster.
